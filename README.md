Welcome to the new era of fiscal responsibility!

This is the beginning of a portfolio optimizer to make rebalancing your holdings using the mean-covariance model easy.

Please let me know if you have any advice on improving the script, both in code organization and the actual mean-covariance model
I have some notes/ideas in to top on the ~portoptruntime.py, and I think changing the lookback period is key here
As my first full stack project, organization is a huge hurdle for me.

any feedback appreciated
